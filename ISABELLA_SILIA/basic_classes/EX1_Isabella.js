//Create 3 different objects for 3 different themes:  car, animal and person. The end result should be 9 objects in total.  
//These objects should have some properties like name, brand, model, type, color, weight, age... of course inherent to its type because, for instance, 
//an animal has no brand... 

// Each object should have at least one method, that shows some properties about each theme. Feel free to expand on that.

// The message from the methods must be printed on the browser too.
